 DESCRIPTION
------------
This project is a page that gets data fron an external provider. In my case, I chose the ticketmaster API in order to display and search events by location.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The code for this project requires a server. 

HOW TO RUN
------------
1. In order to run this project, please download all the files and place them all in the same folder. 
2. Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root.
3. Within the same command-line window, run npm run install to install all dependencies
4. Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser.

ROADMAP OF FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------------
1. Improve the look and feel.
2. Remove the bug on the tag that displays the marks. Currently, since the tag is an h1 and the  original logic of random color from the assignment is left, on clicking the tag, it will change the color of it, leaving the button with a different background-color
3. Disable a button once it has been clicked. Once a button has been filled, the players should not be allowed to re-click on them again. Hence, we can use the filled variable to disable the button as part og the onClick event.
